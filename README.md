# Receipt Processor

This repository contains my solution to the [Fetch Rewards Receipt Processor Challenge](https://github.com/fetch-rewards/receipt-processor-challenge). This project is written in Python 3.12.3, and implements the specified API using a Flask server. For instructions on running the code, see below.

## Running the code

To run this code, clone this repository and enter the root directory:
`cd receipts-challenge`

Start the application by running:
`docker compose up --build`.

Once the application is running, you can make request to the Flask server on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Using CURL:
```
curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/receipts/process' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "retailer": "Target",
  "purchaseDate": "2022-01-01",
  "purchaseTime": "13:01",
  "items": [
    {
      "shortDescription": "Mountain Dew 12PK",
      "price": "6.49"
    },{
      "shortDescription": "Emils Cheese Pizza",
      "price": "12.25"
    },{
      "shortDescription": "Knorr Creamy Chicken",
      "price": "1.26"
    },{
      "shortDescription": "Doritos Nacho Cheese",
      "price": "3.35"
    },{
      "shortDescription": "   Klarbrunn 12-PK 12 FL OZ  ",
      "price": "12.00"
    }
  ],
  "total": "35.35"
}'
```
Output:
```json
{"id":"306a07b5-1132-4fbe-b0da-1db70f0582dc"}
```

### Running tests
I have included a simple test in [test_server.py](/backend/test_server.py), to run these tests in Docker, go to the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) and uncomment line 51 and comment out line 54:
```
Dockerfile (run server)
...
50 # NOTE: To run tests in Docker, uncomment line 51 and comment out line 54
51 # CMD pytest -v backend/test_server.py
52
53 # Run the application.
54 CMD python backend/server.py
```
```
Dockerfile (run tests)
...
50 # NOTE: To run tests in Docker, uncomment line 51 and comment out line 54
51 CMD pytest -v backend/test_server.py

- `test_server.py` contains the pytest for the Flask application

### [Schemas](backend/schemas)
- Contains schemas for Receipts and Items, stored in `receipt.py` and `item.py` respectively

### [Examples](examples)
- Contains 4 JSON files representing examples to be used in `test_server.py`

## Summary of API Specification

### Endpoint: Process Receipts

* Path: `/receipts/process`
* Method: `POST`
* Payload: Receipt JSON following below specification
  
  ```
  retailer:
      description: The name of the retailer or store the receipt is from.
      type: string
      pattern: "^[\\w\\s\\-&]+$"
      example: "M&M Corner Market"
  
  purchaseDate:
      description: The date of the purchase printed on the receipt.
      type: string
      format: date
      example: "2022-01-01"
  
  purchaseTime:
      description: The time of the purchase printed on the receipt. 24-hour time expected.
      type: string
      format: time
      example: "13:01"
  
  items:
      type: array
            minItems: 1
            items:
                $ref: "#/components/schemas/Item"
  
  total:
      description: The total amount paid on the receipt.
      type: string
      pattern: "^\\d+\\.\\d{2}$"
      example: "6.49"
  ```
* Response: JSON containing an id for the receipt.

Description:

Takes in a JSON receipt (see example in the example directory) and returns a JSON object with an ID generated by your code.

The ID returned is the ID that should be passed into `/receipts/{id}/points` to get the number of points the receipt
was awarded.

How many points should be earned are defined by the rules below.

Reminder: Data does not need to survive an application restart. This is to allow you to use in-memory solutions to track any data generated by this endpoint.

Example Response:
```json
{ "id": "7fb1377b-b223-49d9-a31a-5a02701dd310" }
```

## Endpoint: Get Points

* Path: `/receipts/{id}/points`
* Method: `GET`
* Response: A JSON object containing the number of points awarded.

A simple Getter endpoint that looks up the receipt by the ID and returns an object specifying the points awarded.

Example Response:
```json
{ "points": 32 }
```

---

# Rules

These rules collectively define how many points should be awarded to a receipt.

* One point for every alphanumeric character in the retailer name.
* 50 points if the total is a round dollar amount with no cents.
* 25 points if the total is a multiple of `0.25`.
* 5 points for every two items on the receipt.
* If the trimmed length of the item description is a multiple of 3, multiply the price by `0.2` and round up to the nearest integer. The result is the number of points earned.
* 6 points if the day in the purchase date is odd.
* 10 points if the time of purchase is after 2:00pm and before 4:00pm.

# FAQ

### How will this exercise be evaluated?
An engineer will review the code you submit. At a minimum they must be able to run the service and the service must provide the expected results. You
should provide any necessary documentation within the repository. While your solution does not need to be fully production ready, you are being evaluated so
put your best foot forward.

### I have questions about the problem statement
For any requirements not specified via an example, use your best judgment to determine the expected result.

### Can I provide a private repository?
If at all possible, we prefer a public repository because we do not know which engineer will be evaluating your submission. Providing a public repository
ensures a speedy review of your submission. If you are still uncomfortable providing a public repository, you can work with your recruiter to provide access to
the reviewing engineer.

### How long do I have to complete the exercise?
There is no time limit for the exercise. Out of respect for your time, we designed this exercise with the intent that it should take you a few hours. But, please
take as much time as you need to complete the work.
